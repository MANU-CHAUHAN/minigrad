# minigrad
A small autograd repo implementing backpropagation with ability to develop small Neural Networks. Greatly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's  [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)


### TODO:

1) utils and visualizations

2) Cover all operations:
```
Relu, Log, Exp                  # unary ops
Sum, Max                        # reduce ops (with axis argument)
Add, Sub, Mul, Pow              # binary ops (with broadcasting)
Reshape, Transpose, Slice       # movement ops
Matmul, Conv2D                  # processing ops
```
